# Python-AM-FM-PM-Modulation

This repository contains Python code for AM (Amplitude Modulation), FM (Frequency Modulation), and PM (Phase Modulation). The code generates sinusoidal signals, modulates them using AM, FM, and PM, and visualizes the results.

## Abstract

The project demonstrates the generation and modulation of sinusoidal signals using AM, FM, and PM in Python. It uses numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib for visualization, and scipy for signal processing. The code generates multiple sinusoidal signals based on user input, combines them, and then modulates the combined signal using AM, FM, and PM. The modulated signals are then visualized.

## Introduction

AM, FM, and PM are fundamental techniques in signal modulation. They are widely used in radio broadcasting, telecommunications, and signal processing. This project provides Python code that demonstrates these modulation techniques.

## Code

The Python code can be run directly in any environment that supports Python, such as Google Colab. The code generates sinusoidal signals based on user input, combines them, and then modulates the combined signal using AM, FM, and PM. The modulated signals are then visualized using matplotlib.

## Usage

The Python code can be run directly in any Python environment. Here are the steps to run it in Google Colab:

1. Open a new notebook in Google Colab.
2. Copy the code from this repository and paste it into a cell in the notebook.
3. Run the cell to execute the code.

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. Additionally, I already have the ASK, FSK, and PSK modulation programs available. If anyone needs these, please leave a comment and I'll be happy to upload them. I encourage you to make a pull request if you have any improvements or additions to these programs.
